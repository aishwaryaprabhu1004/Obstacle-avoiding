# Obstacle-avoiding
Raspberry pi
Obstacle detection is possible because of the ultrasonic sensor module. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect objects and determine the distance between the sensor and 
the obstacle. When the Pi is poweres ON, it measures the disrance of the object in front of it and compares it with a precalculated value=15 cm. This is then used to determine 
in which direction,the robot has to move.
